# Investigate-a-Dataset
The second project for FWD Scholarship from the ministry of communications in Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree Program
This project was after a very powerful section and important steps in database analysis:

⚫ Collect the Questions

⚫ Data Wrangling [Gather, Assess, and Clean]

⚫ Explore [Visualization]

⚫ Conclusions [The results of the analysis]

⚫ Communication [Presentation or Report]



In this project I choose my dataset to work on it, it collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.
